This dataset is made publically available to support research in the area of end-use energy demand in the domestic building sector. 
Possible topics which this dataset might inform are:
1. Internal environmental conditions and energy demands in UK homes.
2. Analytic techniques for Smart Meter and Smart Home data.
3. Occupant behaviour in UK homes.
4. Model inputs for building energy models.
Please download and make use of this dataset in your own research and we are happy to answer any questions about the dataset and its use.
